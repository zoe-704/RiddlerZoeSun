| 11:40-12 pm | Aug 22 | Saw reu and uzu in the first puzzle, so I thought it could be a caesar shift where reu and uzu corresponded with and and did, which worked out if shifted by 17 originally.                                     |
| 6:50-7:10 pm | Aug 22 | Implement caesar shift for first puzzle.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 10-10:20 pm | Aug 22 | Noticed that all numbers looked like ascii values and converted them to chars. Also, puzzle 3 looks like 8 bit binary chunks that represent letters.                                                            |
| 12-12:30 am | Aug 23 | Implemented puzzle 3 based on earlier idea to convert 8 bit sequence into letters. Unfamiliar with Intellij so had to resolve some issues with sdk.                                                             |
| 9:30-10 pm | Aug 26 | Learned that unicode is the text emoji word standard, and I asked chatgpt what kind of unicode character the first emoji is and learned that they are from the dingbat block. I then implemented this solution. |
