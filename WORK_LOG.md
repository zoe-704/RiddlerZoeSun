| 11:40-12  | Aug 22 | Saw reu and uzu in the first puzzle, so I thought it could be a caesar shift where reu and uzu corresponded with and and did, which worked out if shifted by 17 originally. |
| 6:50-7:10 | Aug 22 | Implement caesar shift for first puzzle.                                                                                                                                    |
| 10-10:15  | Aug 22 | Noticed that all numbers looked like ascii values and converted them to chars. Also, puzzle 3 looks like 8 bit binary chunks that represent letters.                        |                                                                                                                                    |
